                                        The center that focuses on making constant health monitoring a reality. Instead of having a patient come in repeatedly for testing, the development of delicate sensor technology would make it possible for their health and symptoms to receive tireless attention and allow the doctors immediate knowledge of any condition changes. This center is product of the collaboration between the Medicine and Neurology department as well as the Electrical and Computer Science Engineering departments.</p>

									<h2> Hands down, our favorite. </h2><h2>The Device Research Laboratory</h2>
									<p> Under Professor Kang Wang, this laboratory is one of the leading labs in non-volatile spintronics research. Spin electronics (spintronics) is a study that focuses on harnessing the properties of an electron’s spin as opposed to its charge. It is a study that has huge potential in the field of electronics, holding the possibility of rendering the everyday transistor obsolete by providing a compact but safe and inexpensive device with a huge memory. This possibility is owed to influencing the electron’s spin to either oppose or comply with a magnetic field, and this mimics the 1 and 0 options of binary code, or “machine language.” The magnetic random access memory (MRAM) is larger and more compact than the memory currently being provided by transistor technology, and has great potential.

								<h3>The Center for Domain-Specific Computing (CDSC)</h3>
							</header>
							<p title="Center for Domain-Specific Computing. (2009). Research Programs. Retrieved October 28, 2013, from http://www.cdsc.ucla.edu/research/">  It is a center with the goal of optimizing and customizing computing systems. With the ever increasing usage of what they call “general-purpose” computing systems, the researchers intend to prioritize the more important system usages and give them domain-specific qualities while making them more cost effective. The most considered application of domain specific computing is in health care, where important and effective imaging tools are not being used because it is not currently computationally feasible. This center also relies heavily on the work of the Medical Department with Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Departments.</p>

(2010, July 6). $10 MICROSCOPE WINS 3 AWARDS, HEADING TO AFRICA FOR TESTS. Message posted to http://www.singularityhub.com">The Ozcan Research Group is led by UCLA Electrical Engineering Professor Ozcan. His most recent success is his development of the “Lab on a Chip,” an addition to any common cell-phone that would allow the easy capture and imaging of blood samples of patients with HIV or to diagnose them and to monitor the overall health and immune system. His ground-breaking work has the potential to save many lives using equipment that only costs about $10. </p>

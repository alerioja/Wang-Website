"> Power Systems Engineers control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy. With a large portion of current employees approaching retirement age, there will be a huge demand for this type of engineer in the future. Because of emerging “green” technologies such as solar and wind energy there will be an endless supply of opportunities for power engineers over the next few years. As the demand for energy continues to increase, power engineers will be needed to solve the problems of America’s energy crisis.</p>

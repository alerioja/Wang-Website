                                    <h3><strong> Jared Aguayo </strong> </h3><h6>Computer Science and Engineering </h6><br> <p>Engineering leads to innovation and advancement of technology in all fields. It uses previously known knowledge to build on existing ideas and to create entirely new ones. Engineering lets a person create. A person can do things never done before, and working in teams is significant in engineering. Contributing to a team to make something one could not accomplish on their own is rewarding. Engineering results in the continual progression and betterment of humanity. My passion is engineering.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    I personally enjoy the concept of computer science and engineering because it is so versatile. With the evolving of technology, almost all useful devices now contain some connection to software. This means that many companies and corporations are searching for people with these expertise. Not only this, but all you need for the computer science part is a some kind of computing device such as a laptop. You can create new programs from virtually anywhere and anytime. In this digital age, I want to strive to make a difference.

                                    <h3><strong> Alejandro Rioja </strong> </h3><h6>Computer Science and Engineering </h6><br><p>I like to be challenged. I think that at the Engineering School I will find a place that will make me thrive and persevere. I particularly choose Computer Science and Engineering because I always dreamed of creating a product that may transform lifestyles. By blending software and hardware together, I hope to be able to come up with a device that will make our lives easier. Being in front of a computer feels so natural to me, that I cannot imagine not using one every day. </p>
                                    
<h3><strong> Luis Lino </strong> </h3><h6>Electrical Engineering </h6><br> <p>I chose engineering because I wanted to do work that really matters. I have always liked math and science so I knew engineering would be a good fit for me. My passion for learning motivates me to succeed. I chose Electrical Engineering because the field is so broad and there are so many interesting things to work on. I am excited by the fact that there is so much to learn and I am sure that every day as an engineer will present a new challenge</p>
                                    <h3><strong> Gabriella Bustamante </strong> </h3><h6>Electrical Engineering </h6> <br> <p>I chose engineering because I knew I would never be satisfied doing anything else. There are so many options that a degree in engineering makes possible: I could find a job nearly anywhere in the world because of how many applications there are for the skills engineers have, I could work for huge companies or do research in a university setting, or even donate my skills to a cause I believe in. A B.S. in engineering is one of the most versatile degrees anyone can get, and I need a career that would gratify my intellectual side as well as my adventurous side. I don't want to settle into a single job for the rest of my life if I can avoid it.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>I want to be an electrical engineer because I love science and technology and I am a born problem solver. Ever since I was little, it was never good enough for me to know that something worked; I had to know how it worked, and how its performance could be optimized (of course, that isnâ€™t how I thought about it back then). That need only increased when I took physics, electronics, and computer science in high school. Those classes opened up my mind to the world of technological advancement, and made me realize that I wanted to be on the forefront of developing tools for the new and progressively cyber age we have found ourselves in.</p>

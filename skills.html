									<h3>Necessary Skills for Electrical or Computer Science Engineers:</h3></br>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Critical thinking</b> -It’s especially important for Electrical and Computer Science engineers to be critical thinkers because their problems often occur in either nano-scopic or virtual settings, so there isn’t always something physical that can be used to fix them, but rather a way to get around them is all that can be done.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Troubleshooting/debugging</b> -Especially in regards to programming and computer software, troubleshooting is an important skill to have. What good is there in knowing how to code if you can’t correctly diagnose problems that come up?</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Teamwork</b>-For areas as technical as computer science and electrical engineering, it is impossible to do all of the work alone.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Creativity and Design</b>-This is related to both critical thinking and troubleshooting because a creative mind is necessary to come up with practical solutions to difficult problems. If there is a problem in writing a more efficient program, it would be impractical to come up with a whole new programming language specific to that problem; a creative mind would be able to come up with a solution using the available tools.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Programming</b>-This is a basic and important skill because much of electrical engineering and essentially all of computer science is what you can program on a computer.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Soldering and circuit building</b>-Another basic skill, but mostly for electrical engineers who are typically the ones working with hardware.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Knowledge of Math and Physics</b>-It is important to remember the foundations that engineers work on.</p>
                                    
                                    </br><h3>Necessary Skills for working as Software or Electrical Engineers:</h3></br>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Software development experience</b>-Internships, previous jobs, or personal projects are important stepping stones in getting a good grasp fundamental knowledge.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Communication and presentation skills</b>-It is necessary to be able to get a point or a problem across to team members or superiors.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Task management</b>-Often there will be multiple projects or multiple issues that must be seen to, and it is unacceptable to fall behind.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Proficiency in C, C++, Java, MATLAB, MathCAD, or Mathematica</b>-Basic requirements that come with choosing the fields of Electrical Engineering or Computer Science Engineering.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Experience with Mentor Graphics, Cadence, PSpice, Agilent ADS, Ansoft HFSS, Sonnet, or Zeland IE3D</b>-Electrical Engineers have their own software tools to aid in designing, simulating, and analyzing their projects.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Equipment experience with signal sources, oscilloscopes, and spectrum analyzers</b>-Electrical Engineers work with highly specialized equipment for running tests.
